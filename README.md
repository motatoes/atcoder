[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/atcoder/badge/?version=latest)](https://atcoder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


Introduction
===========

This repository will contain translations of [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp) archived contest editorials. Since most (all) of the editorials in ABC contests are in Japanese, this repo will contain translations of these editorials in order to enable competitive programmers to practice on these problems. The documentation will be hosted on readthedocs, and you are welcome to contribute more translations to the problem editorial translations.

List of problem: https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder#/table

Contributing
=============

- install [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html)
- Fork this repository to your local account
- clone **your forked** repository `git pull git@github.com:<username>/atcoder`
- change your directory to the repo and then run `make html`. This will generate the build files in your local directoy.
- Now you will have the generated html files in `_build/html` so you can open the index file and see what it looks like.
- Now select a problem or contest which you want to write an editorial for. You can familiarise yourself with the Sphinx formatting, or just look at once of the [complted editorials](https://github.com/motatoes/atcoder/blob/master/ABC_editorials/ABC125.rst) (view raw). 
- Once you are done, view the result locally to make sure it looks fine, then commit, push and PR :)
